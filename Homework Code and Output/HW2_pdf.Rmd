Questions:
With following data create a .csv file. Call this file Week2Data.csv
```{r}
# create a data.frame
Week2Data <- data.frame(matrix(c(
  1,1,1,1,
  1,1,2,0,
  1,1,1,1,
  1,1,2,1, 
  2,1,1,0, 
  2,1,2,0, 
  2,1,1,0, 
  2,1,2,0, 
  3,1,1,1, 
  3,1,2,1,
  3,1,1,1,
  3,1,2,1,
  4,1,1,0,
  4,1,2,0,
  4,1,1,1,
  4,1,2,1,
  1,2,1,1,
  1,2,2,0,
  1,2,1,1,
  1,2,2,1,

  3,2,2,1,
  4,2,1,0,
  4,2,2,0,
  4,2,1,1,
  4,2,2,1), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)) 
colnames(Week2Data) = c("subNum", "cond1", "cond2", "data")
Week2Data
#
write.csv(Week2Data, file = "Week2Data.csv", row.names = FALSE) #create a .csv file
```

1. Using the read.csv function open Week2Data.csv
```{r}
Week2Data <- read.csv(file = "Week2Data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
  2. Click on the blue arrow next to Week2Data:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("HW2_Q2.png")
# ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25166624/insert-picture-table-in-r-markdown
# https://rdrr.io/cran/knitr/man/include_graphics.html
```
  
  3. Click on “File View” icon
```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("HW2_Q3.png")
```
  
  4. Using the summary() funtion, find the global mean for the data.
```{r}
summary(Week2Data) # the global mean for data is 0.5625
```
  5. At the command line, enter: Week2Data[,'subNum']
```{r}
Week2Data[,'subNum']
```
  6. At the command line, enter: Week2Data[,1]
```{r}
Week2Data[,1]
```
  7. At the command line, enter:
  What do cond11 and cond22 correspond to?
```{r}
cond11 = Week2Data$cond1 == 1 # cond11 is a logic vector that indicates which value in cond1 equals 1
cond11
cond12 = Week2Data$cond1 == 2 # cond12 is a logic vector that indicates which value in cond1 equals 2
cond12
```

  8. At the command line, enter: Week2Data[,'data']
```{r}
Week2Data[,'data']
```
  9. At the command line, enter:
  What is being computed?
```{r}
mean(Week2Data[cond11 == TRUE, 'data']) # this is the mean of the values in data column if cond1 is 1
mean(Week2Data[cond12 == TRUE, 'data']) # this is the mean of the values in data column if cond1 is 2
```
  10. At the commandline,enter
```{r}
x = Week2Data$data
```

  11. At the command line, evaluate x. In other words, what does the variable x equal?
```{r}
x   # x is all the values in data column 
```

  12. At the command line, enter
  What was returned?
```{r}
aggregate(x, by = list(Week2Data$cond1, Week2Data$cond2), FUN = mean) 
# this is the mean of x (values in data column) for each of the cond1 by cond2 combinations
```

  13. Save each of these commands in an R file. This file is called a program or a script. Name the file
Week2Homework{YourName}. Put your answers to the 3 questions I asked in a comment next the
appropriate line of R code. If you completed this assignment properly, I should be able to source or run
your program when I open in RStudio. Place this file in the course Dropbox folder.
